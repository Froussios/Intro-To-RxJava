# Reducing a sequence

The examples we've seen so far were all very small. Nothing should stop you from using Rx on a huge stream of realtime data, but what good would Rx be if it dumped the whole bulk of the data onto you, and force you handle it like you would otherwise? Here we will explore operators that can filter out irrelevant data, or reduce the data to the single value that you want.

Most of the operators here will be familiar to anyone who has worked with Java's `Stream`s or functional programming in general. All the operators here return a new observable and do _not_ affect the original observable. This principle is present throughout Rx. Transformations of observables create a new observable every time and leave the original unaffected. Subscribers to the original observable should notice no change, but we will see in later chapters that guaranteeing this may require caution from the developer as well.

### Marble diagrams

This is an appropriate time to introduce to concept of marble diagrams. It is a popular way of explaining the operators in Rx, because of their intuitive and graphical nature. They are present a lot in the documentation of RxJava and it only makes sense that we take advantage of their explanatory nature. The format is mostly self-explanatory: time flows left to right, shapes represent values, a slash is an onCompletion, an X is an error. The operator is applied to the top sequence and the result is the sequence below.

## Filter

`filter` takes a predicate function that makes a boolean decision for each value emitted. If the decision is `false`, the item is omitted from the filtered sequence.

```java
public final Observable<T> filter(Func1<? super T,java.lang.Boolean> predicate)
```

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/filter.png)

We will use `filter` to create a sequence of numbers and filter out all the odd ones, keeping only even values.

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.range(0,10);
Subscription oddNumbers = values
	.filter(v -> v % 2 == 0)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```

[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter2/reducing/FilterExample.java)
```
0
2
4
6
8
Completed
```

## distinct and distinctUntilChanged

`distinct` filters out any element that has already appeared in the sequence.

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/distinct.png)

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.create(o -> {
	o.onNext(1);
	o.onNext(1);
	o.onNext(2);
	o.onNext(3);
	o.onNext(2);
	o.onCompleted();
});

Subscription subscription = values
	.distinct()
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter2/reducing/DistinctExample.java)
```
1
2
3
Completed
```

An overload of distinct takes a key selector. For each item, the function generates a key and the key is then used to determine distinctiveness.

```java
public final <U> Observable<T> distinct(Func1<? super T,? extends U> keySelector)
```

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/distinct.key.png)

In this example, we use the first character as a key.

```java
Observable<String> values = Observable.create(o -> {
	o.onNext("First");
	o.onNext("Second");
	o.onNext("Third");
	o.onNext("Fourth");
	o.onNext("Fifth");
	o.onCompleted();
});

Subscription subscription = values
	.distinct(v -> v.charAt(0))
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter2/reducing/DistinctExample.java)
```
First
Second
Third
Completed
```

"Fourth" and "Fifth" were filtered out because their first character is 'F' and that has already appeared in "First".

An experienced programmer already knows that this operator maintains a set internally with every unique value that passes through the observable and checks every new value against it. While Rx operators neatly hide these things, you should still be aware that an Rx operator can have a significant cost and consider what you are using it on.

A variant of `distinct` is `distinctUntilChanged`. The difference is that only consecutive non-distinct values are filtered out.

```java
public final Observable<T> distinctUntilChanged()
public final <U> Observable<T> distinctUntilChanged(Func1<? super T,? extends U> keySelector)
```

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/distinctUntilChanged.png)

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.create(o -> {
	o.onNext(1);
	o.onNext(1);
	o.onNext(2);
	o.onNext(3);
	o.onNext(2);
	o.onCompleted();
});

Subscription subscription = values
	.distinctUntilChanged()
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter2/reducing/DistinctExample.java)
```
1
2
3
2
Completed
```

You can you use a key selector with `distinctUntilChanged`, as well.

```java
Observable<String> values = Observable.create(o -> {
    o.onNext("First");
    o.onNext("Second");
    o.onNext("Third");
    o.onNext("Fourth");
    o.onNext("Fifth");
    o.onCompleted();
});

Subscription subscription = values
    .distinctUntilChanged(v -> v.charAt(0))
    .subscribe(
    	    v -> System.out.println(v),
    	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
    	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
    	);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter2/reducing/DistinctExample.java)
```
First
Second
Third
Fourth
Completed
```

## ignoreElements

`ignoreElements` will ignore every value, but lets pass through `onCompleted` and `onError`.

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.range(0, 10);

Subscription subscription = values
	.ignoreElements()
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter2/reducing/IgnoreExample.java)
```
Completed
```

`ignoreElements()` produces the same result as `filter(v -> false)`


## skip and take

The next group of methods serve to cut the sequence at a specific point based on the item's index, and either take the first part or the second part. `take` takes the first n elements, while `skip` skips them. Note that neither function considers it an error if there are fewer items in the sequence than the specified index.

```java
Observable<T> 	take(int num)
```

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/take.png)

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.range(0, 5);

Subscription first2 = values
	.take(2)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```

Users of Java 8 streams should know the `take` operator as `limit`. The `limit` operator exists in Rx too, for symmetry purposes. It is an alias of `take`, but it lacks the richer overloads that we will soon see.

`take` completes as soon as the n-th item is available. If an error occurs, the error will be forwarded, but not if it occurs after the cutting point. `take` doesn't care what happens in the observable after the n-th item.

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.create(o -> {
	o.onNext(1);
	o.onError(new Exception("Oops"));
});

Subscription subscription = values
	.take(1)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter2/reducing/TakeSkipExample.java)
```
1
Completed
```

`skip` returns the other half of a `take`.

```java
Observable<T> 	skip(int num)
```

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/skip.png)

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.range(0, 5);

Subscription subscription = values
	.skip(2)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter2/reducing/TakeSkipExample.java)
```

```

There are overloads where the cutoff is a moment in time rather than place in the sequence.

```java
Observable<T> 	take(long time, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit unit)
Observable<T> 	skip(long time, java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit unit)
```

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);

Subscription subscription = values
	.take(250, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter2/reducing/TakeSkipExample.java)
```
0
1
Completed
```

## skipWhile and takeWhile

`take` and `skip` work with predefined indices. If you want to "discover" the cutoff point as the values come, `takeWhile` and `skipWhile` will use a predicate instead. `takeWhile` takes items while a predicate function returns `true`

```java
Observable<T> 	takeWhile(Func1<? super T,java.lang.Boolean> predicate)
```

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);

Subscription subscription = values
	.takeWhile(v -> v < 2)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter2/reducing/TakeSkipExample.java)
```
0
1
Completed
```

As you would expect, `skipWhile` returns the other half of the sequence

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);

Subscription subscription = values
	.skipWhile(v -> v < 2)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter2/reducing/TakeSkipExample.java)
```
2
3
4
...
```

## skipLast and takeLast

`skipLast` and `takeLast` work just like `take` and `skip`, with the difference that the point of reference is from the end.

```java
Observable<Integer> values = Observable.range(0,5);

Subscription subscription = values
	.skipLast(2)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter2/reducing/TakeSkipExample.java)
```
0
1
2
Completed
```

By now you should be able to guess how `takeLast` is related to `skipLast`. There are overloads for both indices and time.


## takeUntil and skipUntil

There are also two methods named `takeUntil` and `skipUntil`. `takeUntil` works exactly like `takeWhile` except that it takes items while the predictate is false. The same is true of `skipUntil`.

Along with that, `takeUntil` and `skipUntil` each have a very interesting overload. The cutoff point is defined as the moment when _another_ observable emits an item.

```java
public final <E> Observable<T> takeUntil(Observable<? extends E> other)
```

![](https://raw.github.com/wiki/ReactiveX/RxJava/images/rx-operators/takeUntil.png)

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.interval(100,TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
Observable<Long> cutoff = Observable.timer(250, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);

Subscription subscription = values
	.takeUntil(cutoff)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter2/reducing/TakeSkipExample.java)
```

1
Completed
```

As you may remember, `timer` here will wait 250ms and emit one event. This signals `takeUntil` to stop the sequence. Note that the signal can be of any type, since the actual value is not used.

Once again `skipUntil` works by the same rules and returns the other half of the observable. Values are ignored until the signal comes to start letting values pass through.

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.interval(100,TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
Observable<Long> cutoff = Observable.timer(250, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);

Subscription subscription = values
	.skipUntil(cutoff)
	.subscribe(
	    v -> System.out.println(v),
	    e -> System.out.println("Error: " + e),
	    () -> System.out.println("Completed")
	);
```
