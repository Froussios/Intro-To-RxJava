# Leaving the monad

A [monad] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monad_%28functional_programming%29) is an abstract concept from functional programming that is unfamiliar to most programmers. Teaching monads is beyond the scope of this guide. In www.introtorx.com we find a short definition:
> Monads are a kind of abstract data type constructor that encapsulate program logic instead of data in the domain model.

Monads are of interest to us, because the observable is a monad. Rx code declares what needs to be done but the actual processing happens not when Rx statements are executed, but rather when values are emitted. Readers may find it interesting to read more about monads in general. For this guide, when refering to monads the reader only needs to think about the observable.

## Why leave the monad

There are two main reasons one may want to leave the monad. The first reason is that a new Rx developer will still be more comfortable in more traditional paradigms. Doing parts of the computation in a different paradigm may enable you to get some parts working, while you're still figuring out how to do things in Rx. The second reason is that we usually interact with components and libraries that weren't designed with Rx in mind. When refactoring existing code into Rx, it may be useful to have Rx behave in a blocking way.

## BlockingObservable

The first step to getting data out of an observable in a blocking manner is to transition to a [BlockingObservable](http://reactivex.io/RxJava/javadoc/rx/observables/BlockingObservable.html#). Any `Observable` can be converted to a `BlockingObservable` in one of two ways:
You can use the `Observable`'s `toBlocking` method
```java
public final BlockingObservable<T> toBlocking()
```
or the static factory of `BlockingObservable`
```java
public static <T> BlockingObservable<T> from(Observable<? extends T> o)
```

`BlockingObservable` does not extend the `Observable` and it can't be used with our usual Rx operators. It has its own implementations of a small set functions, which allow you to extract data out of an `Observable` in a blocking manner. Many of those methods are the blocking counterparts to methods that we have already seen.

### forEach

`Observable` has a method called `forEach`. `forEach` is defined as an alias to `subscribe`, with the main difference being that it doesn't return a `Subscription`.

Consider this example

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);

values
	.take(5)
	.forEach(v -> System.out.println(v));
System.out.println("Subscribed");
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/leaving/ForEachExample.java)
```
Subscribed
0
1
2
3
4
```

The code here behaves like `subscribe` would. First you register an observer (no overload for `forEach` accepts `Observer`, but the semantics are the same). Execution then proceeds to print "Subscribed" and exits our snippet. As values are emitted (the first one with a 100ms delay), they are passed to our observer for processing.

`BlockingObservable` doesn't have a `subscribe` function, but it has `forEach`. Let's see the same example with `BLockingObservable`

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
		
values
	.take(5)
	.toBlocking()
	.forEach(v -> System.out.println(v));
System.out.println("Subscribed");
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/leaving/ForEachExample.java)
```
0
1
2
3
4
Subscribed
```

We see here that the call to `forEach` blocked until the observable completed. Another difference is that there can be no handlers for `onError` and `onCompleted`. `onCompleted` is a given if the execution completes, while exceptions will be thrown into the runtime to be caught:

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.error(new Exception("Oops"));
		
try	{
	values
		.take(5)
		.toBlocking()
		.forEach(v -> System.out.println(v));
}
catch (Exception e) {
	System.out.println("Caught: " + e.getMessage());
}
System.out.println("Subscribed");
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/leaving/ForEachExample.java)
```
Caught: java.lang.Exception: Oops
Subscribed
```

### first, last, single

`BlockingObservable` has methods for `first`, `last` and `single`, along with implementations for default values `firstOrDefault`, `lastOrDefault` and `singleOrDefault`. Having read about their [namesakes](/Part%202%20-%20Sequence%20Basics/4.%20Aggregation.md#first) in `Observable`, you already know what the returned value is. Once again, the difference is the blocking nature of the methods. They don't return an observable that will emit the value when it is available. Rather, they block until the value is available and return the value itself, without the surrounding observable.

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
		
long value = values
	.take(5)
	.toBlocking()
	.first(i -> i>2);
System.out.println(value);
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/leaving/FirstLastSingleExample.java)
```
3
```

As we can see, the call to `first` blocked until a value was available, and only then was a value returned.

Like with `forEach`, exceptions are thrown in the runtime to be caught

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.interval(100, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
		
try {
	long value = values
		.take(5)
		.toBlocking()
		.single(i -> i>2);
	System.out.println(value);
}
catch (Exception e) {
	System.out.println("Caught: " + e);
}
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/leaving/FirstLastSingleExample.java)
```
Caught: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Sequence contains too many elements
```

### To Iterable

You can transform your observables to [iterables](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Iterable.html) throught a variety of methods on `BlockingObservable`. Iterables are pull-based, unlike Rx, which is push-based. That means that when the consumer is ready to consume a value, one is requested with `next()` on the iterable's [Iterator](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Iterator.html). The call to `next()` will either return a value immediately or block until one is ready.

There are several ways to go from `BlockingObservable<T>` to `Iterable<T>` and each has a different behaviour.

#### toIterable

```java
public java.lang.Iterable<T> toIterable()
```
![](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/images/rx-operators/B.toIterable.png)

In this implementation, all the emitted values are collected and cached. Because of the caching, no items will be missed. The iterator gets the next value as soon as possible, either immediately if it has already occured, or it blocks until the next value becomes available.

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.interval(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
		
Iterable<Long> iterable = values.take(5).toBlocking().toIterable();
for (long l : iterable) {
	System.out.println(l);
}
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/leaving/IterablesExample.java)
```
0
1
2
3
4
```

An interesting thing to note is that either `hasNext()` or `next()` block until the next notification is available. If the observable completes, `hasNext` returns `false` and `next` throws a `java.util.NoSuchElementException`

#### next

```java
public java.lang.Iterable<T> next()
```
![](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/images/rx-operators/B.next.png)

In this implementation values are not cached at all. The iterator will always wait for the next value and return that.

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.interval(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
		
values.take(5)
	.subscribe(v -> System.out.println("Emitted: " + v));

Iterable<Long> iterable = values.take(5).toBlocking().next();
for (long l : iterable) {
	System.out.println(l);
	Thread.sleep(750);
}
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/leaving/IterablesExample.java)
```
Emitted: 0
0
Emitted: 1
Emitted: 2
2
Emitted: 3
Emitted: 4
4

```

In this example the consumer is slower than the producer and always misses the next value. The iterator gets the next after that.

#### latest

```java
public java.lang.Iterable<T> latest()
```

The `latest` method is similar to `next`, with the difference that it will cache one value. The iterator only blocks if no events have been emitted by the observable since the last value was consumed. As long as there has been a new event, the iterator will return immediately with a value, or with the termination of the iteration.

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.interval(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);

values.take(5)
	.subscribe(v -> System.out.println("Emitted: " + v));

Iterable<Long> iterable = values.take(5).toBlocking().latest();
for (long l : iterable) {
	System.out.println(l);
	Thread.sleep(750);
}
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/leaving/IterablesExample.java)
```
Emitted: 0
0
Emitted: 1
1
Emitted: 2
Emitted: 3
3
Emitted: 4
```

When using the `latest` iterator, values will be skipped if they are not pulled before the next event is emitted. If the consumer is faster than the producer, the iterator will block and wait for the next value. 

It is interesting here that 4 was never consumed. That was because an `onCompleted` followed immediately, resulting in the next pull seeing a terminated observable. The implicit `iterator.hasNext()` method reports a terminated observable without checking if the last value has been consumed.

#### mostRecent

```java
public java.lang.Iterable<T> mostRecent(T initialValue)
```
![](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava/wiki/images/rx-operators/B.mostRecent.png)

The `mostRecent` iterator never blocks. It caches a single value, therefore values may be skipped if the consumer is slow. Unlike `latest`, the last cached value is always returned, resulting in repetitions if the consumer is faster than the producer. To allow the `mostRecent` iterator to be completely non-blocking, an initial value is needed. That value is returned if the observable has not emitted any values yet.

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.interval(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
		
values.take(5)
	.subscribe(v -> System.out.println("Emitted: " + v));

Iterable<Long> iterable = values.take(5).toBlocking().mostRecent(-1L);
for (long l : iterable) {
	System.out.println(l);
	Thread.sleep(400);
}
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/leaving/IterablesExample.java)
```
-1
-1
Emitted: 0
0
Emitted: 1
1
Emitted: 2
2
Emitted: 3
3
3
Emitted: 4
```

### Future

A `BlockingObservable<T>` can be presented as a [Future<T>](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Future.html) using the `toFuture` method. This method only creates an instance of `Future` and does not block. Execution blocks as necessary when getting the value. `Future` allows the consumer to decide how to approach an asynchronous operation. A `Future` is also capable of reporting errors in the operation.

```java
Observable<Long> values = Observable.timer(500, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
		
values.subscribe(v -> System.out.println("Emitted: " + v));

Future<Long> future = values.toBlocking().toFuture();
System.out.println(future.get());
```
[Output](/tests/java/itrx/chapter3/leaving/FutureExample.java)
```
Emitted: 0
0
```

`Future`s that are created in this way expect that the observable will emit a single value, just like the `single` method does. If multiple items are emitted, the `Future` will report a `java.lang.IllegalArgumentException`.


## Locks

### Deadlocks

So far we were able to ignore potential deadlocks. Rx's non-blocking nature makes it harder to create unnecessary deadlocks. However, in this chapter we returned to blocking methods, thus bringing deadlocks to the forefront again.

The example below would work as a non-blocking case. But because we used blocking operations, it will never unblock

```java
ReplaySubject<Integer> subject = ReplaySubject.create();

subject.toBlocking().forEach(v -> System.out.println(v));
subject.onNext(1);
subject.onNext(2);
subject.onCompleted();
```

`forEach` returns only after the termination of the sequence. However, the termination event requires `forEach` to return before being pushed. Therefore, `forEach` will never unblock.

### Non-terminating sequences

Some blocking ways to access observables, such as `last()`, require the observable to terminate to unblock. Others, like `first()`, require it to emit at least one event to unblock. Using those methods on `Observable` isn't a big danger, as they only return a non-terminating observable. These same `methods` on `BlockingObservable` can result in a permanent block if the consumer hasn't taken the time to enforce some guarantees, such as timeouts (we will see how this is done in [Timeshifter sequences](/Part 3 - Taming the sequence/5. Time-shifted sequences.md)).
